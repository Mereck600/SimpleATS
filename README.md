# SimpleATS

### Very limited ATS tailored to my own personal excel file and needs
### if you wish to run on a personal sheet update parameters in the script

If you happen to have a sheet with the same column names you can simple run the file in dist and then import the excel sheet

# Notes: Will update soon to allow excel files with other column names to remove the need to have the same sheet
